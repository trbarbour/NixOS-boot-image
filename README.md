# NixOS Boot Image Planner

This repository experiments with a simple planner that turns a high-level storage
plan into a [Disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko) configuration and
invokes Disko to prepare target disks.

See [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) for an in-depth explanation of the storage
planning workflow.
