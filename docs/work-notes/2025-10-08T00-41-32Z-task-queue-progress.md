# Task queue progress review

- **Timestamp:** 2025-10-08T00:41:32Z (UTC)
- **Objective:** Execute the next task queue item by rerunning the VM regression test to capture post-adjustment timings and confirm whether recent LAN/SSH changes improved provisioning.

## Actions

1. Installed the `pexpect` dependency via `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` to unblock the VM tests.
2. Ran `pytest tests/test_boot_image_vm.py` with the existing harness.
3. Archived the serial console output to `docs/boot-logs/2025-10-08T00-41-32Z-serial.log` and recorded the run details in `docs/test-reports/2025-10-08T00-41-32Z-boot-image-vm-test.md`.
4. Reviewed the serial log for `pre-nixos`/`configure_lan` diagnostics and compared against previous failures.

## Findings

- The run completed in 1000.26 seconds (16m40s), longer than the previous 10m21s baseline because the test waited the full IPv4 timeout before failing.
- `pre-nixos` exited immediately with `Provisioning failed`, so storage utilities (`disko`, `lsblk`, `wipefs`) never appeared in PATH. This mirrors the prior regression and indicates the LAN automation work did not fix the root cause yet.
- The serial log still lacks `configure_lan` progress output and never reports a detected interface. `ip -o -4 addr show dev lan` remained empty for the entire run.
- Without network provisioning the new SSH assertions remain untested; the harness never reached the `ssh` verification step.

## Next steps

- Promote task queue item 4 (root-cause the provisioning failure) since the follow-up timing request is blocked on that issue.
- When addressing the provisioning failure, ensure the service emits actionable logs and consider capturing `journalctl -u pre-nixos` during the run.
- Re-run the VM regression after the provisioning/network fixes to gather meaningful timing data and validate SSH connectivity.
