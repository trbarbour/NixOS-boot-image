# Boot image VM test attempt - 2025-10-09T23:39:12Z

## Context
- Objective: rerun `pytest tests/test_boot_image_vm.py` after installing `pexpect` to validate the enhanced login transcript instrumentation.
- Environment: containerised Ubuntu 24.04 (Codex), Python 3.11.12, Nix from `/root/.nix-profile`, QEMU not yet verified because the build step stalled before launch.

## Actions
1. Installed the Python development dependencies to ensure `pexpect` is importable:
   - `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.
2. Invoked `pytest tests/test_boot_image_vm.py -vv` to exercise the boot-image harness end-to-end.
3. Observed `nix build .#bootImage --impure --no-link --print-out-paths` running for >5 minutes without producing any further console output.
4. After ~350s without completion, interrupted pytest with `Ctrl+C` to avoid monopolising the session indefinitely. The KeyboardInterrupt occurred while the Nix build was still compiling dependencies.

## Observations
- `pexpect` no longer triggers an immediate skip; the tests now progress into the boot-image fixture, indicating that the login harness is importable.
- Building the boot image from source inside this container is extremely time-consuming; there were no substitute downloads during the observed window.
- Aborting the run prevents us from verifying the new logging changes in situ; subsequent attempts should reuse the partially built derivations if cached.

## Next Steps
- Allow the Nix build to finish (possibly by running `nix build .#bootImage` ahead of pytest) so that the integration tests can proceed beyond the fixture setup.
- Once the build is cached, rerun `pytest tests/test_boot_image_vm.py -vv` to capture the updated harness transcript behaviour and gather fresh journal excerpts on failure.
- Consider documenting expected build durations in the test plan to set expectations for future runs.
