# Boot Image VM Investigation Log (2025-10-06T16:05:30Z)

## Summary
- Re-ran `tests/test_boot_image_vm.py` with timing capture to obtain a fresh baseline of the failure.
- Archived both the pytest transcript and QEMU serial console output for future reference.
- Recorded the overall wall-clock duration (~10m21s) plus rough phase timing (nix build ~8m, QEMU runtime ~10m) to set expectations for subsequent runs.
- Noted new failure signals: automatic login leaves shell as `nixos`, `sudo -i` escalation fails to reach a root prompt, and pre-nixos storage provisioning reports an error.

## Detailed Timeline
0. 15:54Z - Attempted to wrap the pytest command with `/usr/bin/time`; shell reported the binary missing, so switched to the Bash built-in `time`.
1. 15:54Z - Started `time ./.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_boot_image_vm.py -rs`.
   - Created log sink `docs/test-reports/2025-10-06T15-54-30Z-boot-image-vm-test.log`.
2. 15:54Z-16:02Z - `nix build .#bootImage` executed; `mksquashfs` consumed ~9 minutes CPU.
3. 16:02Z - QEMU launched; serial log now mirrored to `/tmp/pytest-of-root/.../serial.log`.
4. 16:02Z-16:12Z - `_login` waited for a root prompt. Serial output showed automatic login, `__USER__` marker, and storage provisioning warning.
5. 16:12Z - Pexpect timeout triggered; pytest reported two setup errors. Total wall clock: 10m21s.
6. 16:13Z - Copied serial log to `docs/boot-logs/2025-10-06T15-54-30Z-serial.log` for archival.

## Current Hypotheses & Questions
- **Root escalation path**: `sudo -i` may succeed but prompt detection misses the resulting shell because the prompt uses escape sequences; need to inspect raw output for `root@nixos` or adjust regex to accommodate ANSI codes.
- **Storage provisioning error**: Pre-nixos service might fail due to disk layout assumptions or missing devices; require journal logs from the VM to confirm.
- **Serial console completeness**: Boot loader emits output, but verifying kernel parameters for `console=ttyS0,115200` will ensure future debugging has full logs.

## Next Actions (Queued)
Refer to `docs/task-queue.md` for prioritized follow-up items:
- Investigate `_login` prompt matching and sudo behaviour.
- Collect pre-nixos journal logs (potentially by mounting disk image or capturing via serial).
- Explore NixOS configuration adjustments to force serial console output.
- After fixes, repeat timing measurements to verify improvements.

## Lessons / Guardrails
- Always capture both pytest stdout and serial logs when running long VM tests; copy artifacts immediately after failure to prevent loss.
- Record start times for build vs. VM phases to manage expectations and plan iteration loops.
- Use the task queue to register newly discovered work instead of keeping it implicit; this prevents forgetting crucial follow-ups.
