# pre-nixos journalctl verification

- **Objective:** Complete task queue item 2 by confirming structured `pre_nixos` log lines reach `journalctl` in the captured VM debug session.
- **Context:** Review `docs/work-notes/2025-10-10T04-47-41Z-boot-image-vm-debug-session/manual-debug-output.txt` gathered with the harness `--boot-image-debug` flag.

## Findings

- `journalctl -u pre-nixos.service -b` shows JSON `log_event` lines emitted by `pre_nixos.network.configure_lan` and `pre_nixos.network.wait_for_lan`, proving the service forwards structured logs to journald during the stalled provisioning attempt.
- Because journald already records the structured events, no service or harness adjustments are required for logging at this stage. Future investigations can rely on `journalctl` for these entries while focusing on the networking stall captured in the same session.

## Next steps

- Close task queue item 2 as completed and proceed with the subsequent queue items (network bring-up audit and storage investigation) using the captured evidence.
