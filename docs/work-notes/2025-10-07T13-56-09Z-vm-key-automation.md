# Boot image VM key automation and network debugging

## Context
- Date: 2025-10-07T13:56:09Z (UTC)
- Goal: Embed an ephemeral SSH key into the boot image during VM tests, verify SSH login, and ensure the LAN interface configures reliably.

## Actions so far
- Extended the VM integration test harness to generate a session-scoped SSH key pair, pass the public key to `nix build` via `PRE_NIXOS_ROOT_KEY`, and forward a host port for SSH.
- Updated `pre_nixos.configure_lan` to wait for an interface with carrier before renaming it and to log the detected interface (or lack thereof).
- Added an SSH connectivity assertion (`id -un` must return `root`) to the network test once DHCP succeeds.
- First two VM runs exposed several regressions:
  - `BootImageVM.run` kept the echoed shell command in its output, causing `assert_commands_available` to mis-report missing tools even though `OK` appeared on the next line.
  - The LAN rename never occurred, so `ip -o -4 addr show dev lan` timed out.
  - The boot image still skipped provisioning because the packaged `pre_nixos` wheel did not contain `root_key.pub`, so `configure_lan` considered the key absent and bailed out.
- Adjusted `BootImageVM.run` output handling and taught `assert_commands_available` to look for `OK` anywhere in the result so ANSI-littered echoes stop tripping the check.
- Toggled setuptools' `include-package-data` and added `pre_nixos/root_key.pub` as package data so that builds embedding `PRE_NIXOS_ROOT_KEY` actually ship the key inside the Python module.
- Verified via `nix build .#pre-nixos --impure` that the resulting store path contains `pre_nixos/root_key.pub` when the env var points at a readable file.
- Kicked off another VM test run after these fixes; despite the key now being packaged, `pre-nixos` still aborts with "Provisioning failed" and the LAN interface never renames to `lan`. Need to capture `journalctl -u pre-nixos` on the VM to determine why auto-provisioning regressed before addressing SSH verification.

## Next steps
- Inspect the new serial log for `configure_lan` diagnostics to verify whether the interface is detected within the polling window; extend the polling or add a fallback if required.
- Confirm both VM tests pass, including the SSH login assertion, once the current long-running build completes.
- Document the new key-generation requirement in the test plan (done) and ensure CI consumes the updated fixtures.
