# bootImageTest dev shell shared TMPDIR fix

- **Timestamp:** 2025-10-18T17:45:00Z (UTC)
- **Task queue reference:** Active Task 1 â€“ "Make the boot-image build succeed inside the dev shell."

## Context

The boot image build failed inside `nix develop .#bootImageTest` because the default per-shell `TMPDIR` (`/tmp/nix-shell.*`) is mode `0700`, so the sandboxed `nixbld` user could not read the generated `env-vars` file while embedding the disposable SSH key. The task queue calls for making the dev shell always use a world-readable temp directory and verifying the ISO build completes without ad-hoc overrides.

## Actions

1. Updated the `bootImageTest` dev shell `shellHook` in `flake.nix` to create `/tmp/boot-image-shared-tmp`, ensure it has `1777` permissions, and export it through both `TMPDIR` and `PRE_NIXOS_BOOT_IMAGE_TMPDIR` so all nested commands share the accessible path.
2. Verified the hook inside the dev shell with `nix develop .#bootImageTest -c sh -c 'echo TMPDIR=$TMPDIR; ls -ld $TMPDIR'`, confirming the directory and permissions are applied automatically.
3. Rebuilt the ISO inside the dev shell with `nix develop .#bootImageTest -c nix build .#bootImage` (no manual `TMPDIR` override). The build completed successfully and produced `/nix/store/83vw736vi27nryfaa3i2bawy435xspqm-nixos-24.05.20241230.b134951-x86_64-linux.iso/iso/nixos-24.05.20241230.b134951-x86_64-linux.iso`.

## Result

The dev shell now exports a shared temp directory automatically, and the boot image build succeeds without manual environment tweaks. Future pytest runs that spawn impure `nix build` invocations will pick up the shared directory via the exported variables.
