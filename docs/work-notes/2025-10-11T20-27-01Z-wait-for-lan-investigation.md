# 2025-10-11T20:27:01Z - wait_for_lan investigation

## Context
- Task queue item 9 highlighted that `pre_nixos.network.wait_for_lan` never detected an interface during BootImageVM runs even though `ens4` was present but remained down.
- Previous debug sessions (`docs/work-notes/2025-10-10T04-47-41Z-boot-image-vm-debug-session/`) showed the service looping until timeout while `ip -o link` only reported a downed `ens4`.

## Actions
- Updated `pre_nixos.network.wait_for_lan` to nudge physical interfaces up via `ip link set <iface> up` when `PRE_NIXOS_EXEC=1`. This gives virtio NICs a chance to expose carrier before DHCP kicks in.
- Added a fast-path sleep interval when execution is disabled so unit tests using synthetic `/sys/class/net` trees do not spend ~60s waiting for a timeout.
- Re-ran `pytest tests/test_network.py -vv` to confirm the tighter loop still exercises the network helpers successfully.

## Observations
- The nudging logic should allow the VM harness to see `lan` appear without manual intervention, removing one blocker from the BootImageVM impasse.
- Unit tests now finish in ~6s instead of >1 minute whenever no interfaces exist in the tmpdir, improving local feedback loops.

## Next steps
- Rebuild the ISO and re-run `pytest tests/test_boot_image_vm.py -vv --boot-image-debug` to confirm the virtio NIC comes up automatically and the provisioning service advances past the LAN wait.
- Capture fresh journald and `ip` output if the interface still fails to appear so we can iterate on additional instrumentation.
