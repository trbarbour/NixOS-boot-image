# Boot image VM test attempt (2025-10-10T00:17:07Z)

## Context
- Objective: rerun `pytest tests/test_boot_image_vm.py -vv` without interrupting execution for at least 30 minutes, per updated policy.
- Prerequisites: installed `pexpect` (4.9.0) and `ptyprocess` (0.7.0) via `pip install pexpect` to prevent pytest skips.

## Execution timeline
- 00:07Z: kicked off pytest run.
- 00:07Z-00:16Z: `nix build .#bootImage --impure --no-link --print-out-paths` executed as part of fixture setup; allowed to proceed without interruption.
- 00:16Z: pytest reported fixture setup error for both VM tests; total wall-clock 577.94s (~9m38s).

## Observations
- `nix path-info --json <store path>` returned an empty JSON array, triggering `KeyError: 0` when the harness attempted to read `info_json[0]`.
- No VM boot occurred because fixture setup failed prior to launching QEMU.
- Serial/journal captures were therefore not produced for this run.

## Follow-up actions
- Adjust the login harness to tolerate empty `nix path-info` responses (e.g., guard on `info_json` truthiness before subscripting).
- Confirm whether the absence of path-info results indicates a build or caching anomaly; investigate `nix path-info` invocation manually.
- Re-run the integration tests after addressing the fixture guard to observe provisioning behavior over the full 30-minute window if necessary.
