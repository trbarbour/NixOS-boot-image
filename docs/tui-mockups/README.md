# TUI Mock Reference Frames

This folder collects ASCII snapshots that guided the adaptive storage-plan renderer:

- `detailed-mixed-tier.md` — fully expanded view on a large terminal, demonstrating SSD/HDD tiers, mismatch badges, and focus pins.
- `minimal-overview-80x24.md` — minimal density layout captured after probing an 80×24 terminal.
- `existing-vs-planned.md` — paired frames comparing live storage against the computed plan while keeping the same focus anchor.

Implementers can copy individual frames into unit tests or manual notes when validating the renderer.
