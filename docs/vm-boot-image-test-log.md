# VM Boot Image Test Log

## Context
- Task: exercise `tests/test_boot_image_vm.py` end-to-end, identify and resolve failures.
- Environment: containerized Linux dev shell where Nix is installed by automation but requires shell integration to expose the CLI.

## Test Sessions

### Session 1 - Repository Baseline (pytest)
- **Command:** `pytest`
- **Result:** All repository tests reported as passing without modification.
- **Notes:** Confirms non-VM suite health before focusing on VM scenario.

### Session 2 - Initial VM Test Attempt
- **Command:** `pytest tests/test_boot_image_vm.py -rs`
- **Result:** Skipped because Python dependency `pexpect` was missing.
- **Observation:** Test fixture `_pexpect` explicitly skips when `pexpect` cannot be imported.
- **Action:** Install development requirements via `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` to provide `pexpect`.

### Session 3 - Post-Dependency Installation
- **Command:** `pytest tests/test_boot_image_vm.py -rs`
- **Result:** Still skipped, now reporting missing executable `nix`.
- **Observation:** Fixture `boot_image_iso` requires the `nix` CLI to build the boot image; the executable was absent from `$PATH` even though `/nix` and the user profile existed.
- **Investigation:** Discovered that the Codex maintenance script already installs Nix and advises sourcing `$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh`. The script early-outs when `USER` is unset, which occurs in non-login shells launched by the automation. As a result the PATH export never executes.
- **Action:** Patched `scripts/codex-maintenance.sh` so it always exports `USER=${USER:-$(id -un)}` before sourcing `nix.sh` by rewriting `~/.profile`. Running the maintenance script now injects the guard line ahead of the Nix profile sourcing, ensuring subsequent login shells load Nix onto the path.
- **Follow-up:** Opening a new login shell (e.g. `bash --login`) now reports `nix` on the PATH. Manual sessions can recover immediately by running `export USER=$(id -un); . "$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh"`.

### Session 4 - Python Dependency Check
- **Command:** `./.venv/bin/pip show pexpect`
- **Result:** Reports `pexpect 4.9.0` installed inside the project virtualenv, matching `requirements-dev.txt`.
- **Observation:** Prior skips stemmed from invoking `pytest` without activating the virtualenv. Use `source .venv/bin/activate` (or run tools via `./.venv/bin/...`) before executing the suite to guarantee dependencies resolve.

### Session 5 - Root Escalation Guardrails
- **Command:** `pytest tests/test_boot_image_vm.py -rs`
- **Result:** Still encountering timeouts while negotiating the automatic login prompt despite Nix and `pexpect` availability.
- **Action:** Reworked `BootImageVM._login` to detect the auto-login banner, skip issuing `root` when the `nixos` account is already authenticated, and add an explicit `id -u` probe that escalates to root with `sudo -i` whenever the shell remains a non-root user. The escalation path now verifies success and fails fast if root cannot be acquired.
- **Status:** The QEMU boot/build pipeline is lengthy (~10 minutes per attempt) and interrupts were required while iterating. A full green run is still pending and should be re-attempted once the nix build artefacts are cached for faster feedback.

## Conclusions
- Progressed from generic skip to identifying missing shell integration for preinstalled tooling (`nix`).
- Resolved the `nix` visibility issue by patching the maintenance script; future shells expose the CLI automatically, and manual recovery steps are documented.
- Clarified that Python dependencies are present inside `.venv` and must be consumed by activating the virtual environment before running the VM suite.
- Hardened the VM login routine with an `id -u` guard so that future debugging operates from a guaranteed root shell; further end-to-end validation is outstanding because of long-running nix builds.
