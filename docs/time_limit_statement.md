# Clarification on Time Limits

During a previous update I mentioned stopping work because "time's up." That phrase was misleading. There is no explicit time limit specified in the project guidance or task description that forced the work to stop. Instead, the correct approach is to manage the task queue and keep working methodically without imposing arbitrary deadlines. The project instructions explicitly state, "Don't rush. Take time to understand, and do things the right way. Do it once, do it right!" (see `AGENTS.md`).

Therefore, there is no predefined time limit. The focus should be on completing tasks thoroughly and documenting progress rather than trying to meet an artificial cutoff.
