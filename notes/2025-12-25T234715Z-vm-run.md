# VM run log — 2025-12-25T23:47:15Z (UTC)

## Command
- `pytest tests/vm/test_pre_nixos_vm.py tests/vm/test_pre_nixos_cleanup.py -q`
- Dependencies: installed `pexpect` via `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.

## Result
- **Error** during setup of `test_pre_nixos_cleans_raid_lvm_residue`: QEMU exited immediately with `Could not set up host forwarding rule 'tcp:127.0.0.1:51997-:22'`.
- Cause: both session-scoped VM fixtures reused the same forwarded SSH port, so the cleanup VM collided with the still-running single-disk VM from the earlier scenarios.

## Artifacts
- Run logs: `notes/2025-12-25T234604Z-vm-run/logs/` (harness, serial, diagnostics, metadata).
- Timings from metadata: build ~655s; total runtime recorded before failure ~0.08s; no boot/SSH timings because QEMU aborted.
- Ledger entry appended to `notes/vm-run-ledger.jsonl`.

## Next steps
- Make the SSH port assignment per-VM (not shared across session fixtures) to prevent host-forward collisions, then rerun the VM suite.
