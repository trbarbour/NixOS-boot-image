# VM timing ledger instrumentation — 2025-12-22T134320Z (UTC)

## What changed
- Added a JSONL run ledger writer that records each VM fixture invocation with timing metadata, QEMU command, SSH details, pytest args, and timeouts to `notes/vm-run-ledger.jsonl` (override via `BOOT_IMAGE_VM_LEDGER_PATH`, disable with `BOOT_IMAGE_VM_DISABLE_LEDGER`).
- Threaded invocation arguments and per-run outcomes into the ledger so we can correlate failures to specific pytest commands.
- Documented the ledger controls in `tests/vm/README.md`.

## Next steps
- Execute the VM suites and capture the resulting ledger entries plus logs under `notes/`.
- Extend the ledger entries with pointers to copied artifacts once the log-copy flow is implemented.
