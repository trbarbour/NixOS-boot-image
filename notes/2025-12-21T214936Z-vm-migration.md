# VM test split progress (2025-12-21T214936Z)

## Summary
- Created `tests/vm/` scaffolding modules (`fixtures.py`, `metadata.py`, `controller.py`, `cleanup_plan.py`) and placeholder test files to receive migrated scenarios.
- Documented the new layout, runtime expectations, and timeout environment variables in `tests/vm/README.md`.
- Threaded generous default VM spawn/login timeouts (900s/300s) through `tests.test_boot_image_vm` via the shared fixtures module.

## Tests
- Not run (structural scaffolding only; VM runs deferred until fixtures move).
