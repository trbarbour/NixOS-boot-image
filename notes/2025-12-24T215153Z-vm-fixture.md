# VM harness adjustments — 2025-12-24T21:51:53Z (UTC)

## Changes
- Split the VM fixture into single-disk (`boot_image_vm`) and extended (`boot_image_vm_with_additional_disks`) variants so the RAID/LVM residue scenario can reserve `/dev/vdb` and `/dev/vdc` until seeding.
- Updated the residue test to consume the additional-disk fixture and refreshed README guidance to match.
- Added defensive stubs around `_raise_with_transcript` in unit tests to accept diagnostic kwargs.

## Tests
- `pytest tests/vm/test_controller_unit.py tests/vm/test_cleanup_plan_unit.py -q` (passes after installing `pexpect`).
