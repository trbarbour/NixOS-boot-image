# VM run log — 2025-12-26T00:00:17Z (UTC)

## Command
- `pytest tests/vm/test_pre_nixos_vm.py tests/vm/test_pre_nixos_cleanup.py -q`

## Result
- **Error** during setup of `test_pre_nixos_cleans_raid_lvm_residue`: QEMU aborted with `Failed to get "write" lock` on the primary disk image, then exited with EOF before any login prompt.
- Cause: both session-scoped VM fixtures reused the same base disk image; the cleanup VM attempted to open the image while the single-disk VM from the earlier scenarios was still running.

## Artifacts
- Run logs: `notes/2025-12-25T235915Z-vm-run/logs/` (harness, serial, diagnostics, metadata).
- Timings from metadata: build ~431s; no boot/SSH timings captured; total runtime before abort ~0.17s.
- Ledger entry appended to `notes/vm-run-ledger.jsonl`.

## Next steps
- Allocate unique disk images per VM fixture (and keep SSH ports distinct) so concurrent session fixtures do not contend for the same resources. Re-run the VM suite afterward.
