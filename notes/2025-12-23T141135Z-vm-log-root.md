# VM log directory automation

## Summary
- Switched the VM fixture log directory to a timestamped folder under `notes/<UTC>-vm-run/logs/` so serial/harness logs and diagnostics persist without manual copying.
- Added `BOOT_IMAGE_VM_LOG_ROOT` override for cases where logs need to live on a scratch volume; ledger path configuration remains unchanged.
- Documented the new default and override in `tests/vm/README.md` to align with the logging discipline in the VM test plan.
